This library allows easy access to a ethercat network provided by the IgH
EtherCAT master. The nodes are scanned during initialisation and the necessary
PDO configuration is done automatically with the information from the slaves
itself.

Additionaly functions for easy access to the object dictionary and the
contained objects are provided.
